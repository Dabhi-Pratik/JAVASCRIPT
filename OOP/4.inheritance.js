// **Inheritance** => Inheritance allows us to access parent class properties and methods in a child class.

// example


class College {
  constructor(name, university, location) {
    this.name = name;
    this.university = university;
    this.location = location;
  }

  collegeFullDetails() {
    return `Name:${this.name},University:${this.university},Location:${this.location}`
  }
}

const collegeDetails = new College("ABC", "XYZ", "Downtown Area");

// now i want to create student class and want to inherit  properties from parent class School

class Student extends College {
  constructor(name, university, location, studentName, studentCourse) {
    super(name, university, location);
    this.studentName = studentName;
