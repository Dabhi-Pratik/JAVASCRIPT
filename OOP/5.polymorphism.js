//**Polymorphism ** => Polymorphism means having many different forms.We can overwrite a method inherited from a parent class

class Game {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    play() {
        return `I am Playing ${this.name} game.`
    }
}


const game = new Game("GTA-5")
console.log(game.play()); // Output:I am playing GTA-5 game.

class MultiPlayer extends Game {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name)
    }

    play() {
        return `I am playing ${this.name} game with my friends.`
    }
}




const MultiPlayerGame = new MultiPlayer("COD")
console.log(MultiPlayerGame.play()) // Output: I am playing COD game with my friends

// In the above example, we have a Game class with a play method. We have another class MultiPlayer that extends the Game class and overwrites the play method. When we call the play method on the MultiPlayer class object, it returns a different message than the Game class object. This is polymorphism in action.
