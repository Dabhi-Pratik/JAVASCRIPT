// An array in JavaScript is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. It can hold various data types and allows for dynamic resizing. Elements are accessed by their index, starting from 0


// example

// creating an array using array literals

let name = ["Pratik","Utsav","Vaishali","Dharmik","Brij"]

console.log(typeof name) // array it self is type of an object

console.log("BatchMates: ",name)

// creating using array constructor

let numArray = new Array(11,22,33,44)

console.log("numArray",numArray)
